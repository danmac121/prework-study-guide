          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>It is important to use the heading tags appropriately to make the page accessible to users who use screen readers</li>

          <li>It is important to include alt text after an image for users using a screen reader or if the link to the image breaks</li>

          <li>The footer usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

          <li>The Header appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>

          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>The id attribute is more specific than the class attribute, and the class attribute is more specific than tags</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a programming language used to define the style of a webpage and how it will be presented to users.</li>

          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options</li>

          <li>Webpages can be styled using inline css, internal css style sheets, or external style sheets.  </li>

          <li>Internal style sheets contain the css rules for that page in the head.  </li>

          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is with an external style sheet, in a seperate file, which is then linked through the head of your html document. </li>

          <li>CSS uses selectors followed by property-value pairs to make declarations and all given declarations make up a declaration block.  </li>

          <li> Margin determines the space given around an element, padding determines the space given around the content within a given element. </li>

          <li> The height and width of an element, plus the padding, border and margins on all sides constitute the box model. You can calculate the total height/ width of an element by adding the values of these properties together. </li>

          <li>You can use a comma to combine selectors and allow for the styles that follow to effect both selectors.  </li>

          <li> You can select colors in CSS by typing the name of the color, entering the hexidecimal value, the rgb or rgba value, or the HSL value you desire. </li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>We use the cd command to navigate to file directories.</li>

          <li>We use the code . command to open the current directory in vs code</li>

          <li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>

          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>

          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch</li>

          <li>After the flag, we create the name of our new branch, it is wise to include a prefix, such as feature, to indicate what is being changed in this branch</li>

          <li>We use the git status command to ensure that we are working in the new branch</li>

          <li>To add code to the current branch, we use the command git add -A to indicate that we want to add all changes</li>

          <li>Once we have staged files to be committed, we use the git commit command, followed by a commit message, to commit the changes</li>

          <li>The commit message should describe what the commit contains</li>

          <li>We can use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment</li>

          <li> It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>

          <li>We can use the push command to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>

          <li>After pushing the changes to github, we need to navigate to the branch we were working on, use the new pull request button, ensure that the branches are able to be merged, then merge them.</li>

        <h2>Java Script</h2>

        <ul>

          <li> JavaScript is what allows us to interact with webpages. </li>

          <li> Variables are containers that store values. You use the "var" keyword to declare a variable and then use the name that you will give the variable. </li>

          <li> Variables may hold different values, including strings, which need to be enclosed in quotation marks, numbers which do not need quotation marks, the words true and false, and arrays which allow you to store multiple values and objects.  </li>

          <li> We can use conditionals to test if an expression returns true or false. A common way to do this is with if else statements, where if the expression is true, we will recieve one result and if false we will recieve the else result. </li>

          <li> We can use functions to package funtionality we wish to reuse. This allows us to define some code as a function which is executed when we call that function's name instead of rewriting the same code repeatedly. </li>

          <li>Event handlers allow us to make our sites more interactive by listening for certain activity in the browser and running specific code in response to actions taken by the user.  </li>

          <li> JS code is read from top to bottom, so the order we code statements in will effect the final outcome. This is why we must take into account control flow when writing JS. </li>

          <li>Control flow can be interrupted by conditonal statements.  </li>

          <li>Arrays are variables which allow us to hold a group of data. We declare the variable in the same way but we assign multiple values instead of just one. Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once, including different types of data.  </li>

          <li>Pieces of data stored in an array are indexed, beginning with the first value being 0,and subsequent values increasing by one each time.  </li>

          <li>For loops allow a task to be performed on all items in an array by allowing a single block of code to be executed until we use another statement to interrupt the control flow. To use a for loop we need the array's length to know how many times the code can be run until there are no items left in the array.  </li>

          <li>For loops contain three important statements, the starting point for the loop, the condition that dictates if the loop keeps running, and the statement that allows the array to iterate over each item.  </li>

          <li>We use the function keyword to create a function, then we give it a unique name which will be used whenever we call the function. Functions must be called if they are to be executed.  </li>
