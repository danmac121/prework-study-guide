          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>It is important to use the heading tags appropriately to make the page accessible to users who use screen readers</li>

          <li>It is important to include alt text after an image for users using a screen reader or if the link to the image breaks</li>

          <li>The footer usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

          <li>The Header appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>

          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>The id attribute is more specific than the class attribute, and the class attribute is more specific than tags</li>

        <ul>

          <li>We use the cd command to navigate to file directories.</li>

          <li>We use the code . command to open the current directory in vs code</li>

          <li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>

          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>

          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch</li>

          <li>After the flag, we create the name of our new branch, it is wise to include a prefix, such as feature, to indicate what is being changed in this branch</li>

          <li>We use the git status command to ensure that we are working in the new branch</li>

          <li>To add code to the current branch, we use the command git add -A to indicate that we want to add all changes</li>

          <li>Once we have staged files to be committed, we use the git commit command, followed by a commit message, to commit the changes</li>

          <li>The commit message should describe what the commit contains</li>

          <li>We can use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment</li>

          <li> It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>

          <li>We can use the push command to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
