# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This prework study guide was created to assist developers in the early stages of the penn coding bootcamp. It was made using HTML to give structure, CSS to add style, and JS for loops and functions to log in the console one random subsection of the study guide to work on. During the development of this guide, I learned the basics of building a static webpage and the importance of seperation of concerns and how CSS and Js files are read from top to bottom.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to review topics learned in the prework materials provided by the bootcamp. In the console you can see the JS determine which section of the guide to work on. Each section has what I felt were the most important take-aways from the given learning materials.
